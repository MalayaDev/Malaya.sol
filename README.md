Malaya contract

Malaya protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from BEE with some added benefits. 

No DEV coins, no taking of any advantages from the rest.
We also utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 1737 days(4 years, 9 months, 1 day excluding the end date).

Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project.

100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible.
