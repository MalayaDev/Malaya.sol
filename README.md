# Malaya.sol
Malaya contract

Malaya protocol is a mixture of RFI tokenomics with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from BEE with some added benefits. A proud fork from Safemoon.

No DEV coins, no taking of any advantages from the rest.
Like Safemoon, we utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 4 years.

Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project.

100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. 

#Freedom from fear! Be Financially free to the moon!
